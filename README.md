Project Name: LeetMetric â€“ LeetCode User Metrics Dashboard

Description:
LeetMetric is a responsive web application that allows users to track and visualize their LeetCode problem-solving statistics. The project emphasizes dynamic data fetching, interactive UI, and client-side processing. It helped me gain hands-on experience in web development, networking, and JavaScript concepts.

Technical Highlights & Learnings:

API Integration & Networking: Learned how to make GraphQL API calls to external services, handle responses, and parse JSON data to dynamically populate the UI.

Error Handling & Validation: Implemented input validation for usernames and robust error handling for failed network requests or invalid responses.

CORS & Proxy Management: Gained practical knowledge of Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) issues and using proxy solutions to fetch data from third-party APIs.

JavaScript Concepts: Applied advanced JS concepts including asynchronous programming with async/await, DOM manipulation, dynamic CSS variable updates, and ES6 features like arrow functions and template literals.

Frontend Development & UI/UX: Built a modern, responsive interface using CSS Flexbox and Grid, dynamic progress circles, and interactive cards for better data visualization.

Responsive Design: Ensured cross-device compatibility with media queries and mobile-first design principles.

Debugging & Logging: Used console logging and careful exception handling to debug API responses and UI updates effectively.

Outcome:
Through this project, I learned to integrate APIs into a frontend application, manage asynchronous network calls, handle errors gracefully, and create visually appealing, responsive interfaces. It strengthened my understanding of real-world web development practices and client-server communication.
